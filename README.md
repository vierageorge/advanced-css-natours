# Natours

I have commited on learning CSS. This is one of the projects in which I'll be working on while taking the [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course on Udemy.

## Learnings

The following is just a list of css properties and tricks that were new to me while going over the videos.
